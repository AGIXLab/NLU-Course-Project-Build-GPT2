# NLU Course Default Final Project: Build GPT-2

This is the default final project for the Natural Language Understanding class. 

This project comprises two parts. In the first part, you will implement some important components of the GPT-2 model to
better understand its architecture.
In the second part, you will use the token embeddings produced by your GPT-2 model on two downstream tasks: paraphrase
detection and sonnet generation. You will implement extensions to improve your model's performance on these tasks.

In broad strokes, Part 1 of this project targets:

* modules/attention.py: Missing code blocks.
* modules/gpt2_layer.py: Missing code blocks.
* models/gpt2.py: Missing code blocks.
* classifier.py: Missing code blocks.
* optimizer.py: Missing code blocks.

To test Part 1, you will run:

* `optimizer_test.py`: To test your implementation of `optimizer.py`.
* `sanity_check.py`: To test your implementation of GPT models.
* `classifier.py` : To perform sentiment classification using your models.

In Part 2 of this project, you will use GPT2 (via cloze-style classification) detect if one sentence is a paraphrase of 
another as well as generate sonnets via autoregressive language modeling.  

To test Part 2, you will run:

* `paraphrase_detection.py`: To perform paraphrase detection. 
* `sonnet_generation.py`: To perform sonnet generation.

Important: Adjust training hyperparameters, particularly batch size, according to your GPU's specifications to optimize performance and prevent out-of-memory errors.

## Pre-testing instructions

While there are missing code blocks that you need to implement in both of these files, the main focus of this second 
part are the extensions: how you modify your GPT2 model to improve its ability to determine if one sentence is a 
paraphrase of another as well as its ability to generate sonnets. 

## Setup instructions

Follow `setup.sh` to properly setup a conda environment and install dependencies.
